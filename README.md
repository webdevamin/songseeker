# SongSeekr

You heared a fantastic song. You want to put it to your playlist but you don't know the title of it.
You can use Shazam: you can hum to find the song. But what if you knew some text used in the lyrics from heart?
This app is made for it: just type a string of keywords, get that favorite track and save it to your playlist!

## Usage

Type a string of keywords in the search bar, press enter and voil√†! You get a list of tracks matching that text.
The system finds them by author name, title, lyrics and album.
Make sure you don't type short and/or vague keywords like "feel like" or "beautiful".
Thousands or possibly millions of tracks would show up on your screen which is not even worth finding the song you're looking for.
Furthermore, the maximum amount of songs to provide is 1000.
If that's the case, you will be redirected to the homepage with a proper message.

A good example of usage would be this: typing "stand up join us" in the search bar because, let's say this string of keywords
is used frequently in the track you were listening to. So it's easier to remember.
As of now (March 2021) there are 4 tracks containing this string.

### Important to know

A string of keywords is considered as **one**!
Which means that the system takes the string as a whole and does not consider every keyword as a tag.
